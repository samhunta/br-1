# Economy

All fees incurred are pooled into governance tokens that will be awarded for their efforts.

# Roadmap
  - Gas balancing: When your tribe creates transactions during low gas price
    times, it adds a 15% fee to your gas that is pooled into the bang rocks gas reserve.
    During higher gas price times your transactions will tap the gas reserve for a slight gas refund, allowing gas prices to balance somewhere in the middle at most times.
  - Pooling user assets into a tribe. NFTs included.

- a bangtag can be a user or gang. a user membership doesn't cost anything, you just need to own some coin of the gang.
- create verified users
- !bangtag invite
- create a !bangtag, this is the name of your gang but you can change the pronoun (eg. gang, squad, tribe, church, gov, ghouls, etc).
